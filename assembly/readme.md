Assembly Orbit
===
This was an AVR assembly program made to read orbital radius and gravity from memory and calculate the orbital velocity and period as part of the Assembly class (CS???). AVR assembly only supports 8-bit registers, so supporting calculations for up to 72-bit values was difficult. The project code may be found [here](https://github.com/mjrad/Assembly_Orbit).
