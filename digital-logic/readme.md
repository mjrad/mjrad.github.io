SNES Adapter
===
The SNES Adapter was a design project for Digital Logic Design (CS???). With a team of other students, I created diagrams showing how one would connect digital logic pieces to convert SNES input to a moving sprite output. The project code may be found [here](https://github.com/mjrad/SNES-Digital_Logic).
