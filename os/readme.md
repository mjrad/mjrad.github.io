JOS
===
JOS is a relatively simple operating system based on labs from MIT. This was built over the course of 3 months for the Operating Systems course (CS???). The project code may be found [here](https://github.com/mjrad/JOS).

<SCREENSHOT HERE>

Following the prompts of the labs, I put together the missing pieces to allow mutli-threading, error handling, backtracing, and file I/O.
